##Personal notes

To create a new section:

1. run `ng ng generate component <nameOfComponent>` to generate a component.
1. Add it to the router `app-routing.module.ts`.
1. If you want to add it to the menu add it to the menuItems array in the `app.component.ts` file.

##Spec files

No testing has been done, spec files need to be refactored and tests need to be implemented in the working flow.
